### About the Event  
The **AI for Cybersecurity Research Lunch** is a weekly event at Texas A&M University where students and researchers present their latest work in cybersecurity and AI. Talks are open to all, but regular attendees are expected to present their research at least once.  

üìÖ **Date:** February 5, 2025  
üïõ **Time:** 12:00 PM - 1:00 PM  
üìç **Location:** PETR 214, Texas A&M University  

### Speaker  
**Mabon Ninan** - PhD Student @ Texas A&M University  
Mabon Ninan is a first-year PhD student working under **Dr. Marcus Botacin**, focusing on **machine learning for malware detection**. His research builds on his prior work at the University of Cincinnati, where he explored deep learning-based side-channel attacks.

### Abstract  
A **side-channel attack** exploits unintentional information leaks‚Äîsuch as power consumption, timing variations, or electromagnetic emissions‚Äîto infer sensitive data from a system. Recent studies have demonstrated that **deep learning** can significantly enhance the success of these attacks compared to traditional statistical methods. However, deep-learning-based attacks are **highly sensitive to software and hardware discrepancies**, making their real-world applicability more complex than initially assumed.  

This talk provides an in-depth analysis of how **software and physical discrepancies** affect side-channel attacks, discussing their implications for attack portability. We explore strategies for building **more robust and transferable attacks**, ensuring effectiveness across diverse environments.
