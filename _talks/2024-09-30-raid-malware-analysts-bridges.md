Malware analysis tasks are as fundamental for modern cybersecurity as they are challenging to perform. More than depending on any tool capability, malware analysis tasks depend on human analystsâ€™ abilities, experiences, and practices when using the tools. Academic research has traditionally been focused on producing solutions to overcome malware analysis technical challenges, but are these solutions adopted in practice by malware analysts? Are these solutions useful? If not, how can the academic community improve its practices to foster adoption and cause a greater impact? To answer these questions, we surveyed 21 professional malware analysts working in different companies, from CSIRTs to AV companies, to hear their opinions about existing tools, practices, and the challenges they face in their daily tasks. In 31 questions, we cover a broad range of aspects, from the number of observed malware variants to the use of public sandboxes and the tools the analysts would like to exist to make their lives easier. We aim to bridge the gap between academic developments and malware practices. To do so, on the one hand, we suggest to the analysts the solutions proposed in the literature that could be integrated into their practices. On the other hand, we also point out to the academic community possible future directions to bridge existing development gaps that significantly affect malware analysis practices.
