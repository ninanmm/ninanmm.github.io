## About Me

I’m a first-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at **Texas A&M University**, advised by [Dr. Marcus Botacin](https://marcusbotacin.github.io/). My research focuses on building **secure, interpretable, and robust machine learning systems** for real-world applications in **malware detection**, **embedded systems**, and **medical imaging**.

My goal is to bridge foundational work in **AI robustness and explainability** with practical deployments in **cybersecurity** and **healthcare**.

## Research Interests

- **Explainable AI (XAI)** – Interpretable ML models for malware detection and medical decision support  
- **Adversarial Machine Learning** – Robust defenses against evasive malware and attacks on AI systems  
- **Multimodal & Multi-View Learning** – Integrating binaries, APIs, YARA rules, and text for holistic detection  
- **Self-Supervised & Unsupervised Learning** – Leveraging unlabeled data to adapt across domains  
- **Side-Channel Attacks** – Understanding leakage and defense via deep learning over EM traces  
- **Tiny Neural Networks & Model Compression** – Efficient models for embedded and low-power devices  
- **Generative Models & Algorithmic Robustness** – Using generative AI to simulate malware and improve detectors  
- **AI for Medical Imaging** – Interpretable and robust pediatric radiology models in collaboration with Cincinnati Children’s Hospital

## Academic Background

I earned my **B.S. in Computer Engineering** from the **University of Cincinnati**, graduating **summa cum laude**. During undergrad, I worked with [Dr. Boyang Wang](https://homepages.uc.edu/~wang2ba/) on **domain adaptation** and **tiny neural networks**. That work led to multiple papers at top-tier conferences.
